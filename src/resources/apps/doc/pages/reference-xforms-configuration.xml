            <title>Browser Navigation (Back and Forward) Handling</title>
            <p>
                When visiting an XForms page by using your browser's Back and Forward buttons, or other
                browser-history mechanisms, Orbeon Forms by default restores the appearance of that page as it was
                when you left it. (Browsers don't automatically handle this behavior with Ajax applications!) This
                behavior best matches the usual user experience obtained when navigating regular web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In certain situations, it can be useful instead to ask the XForms page to reload entirely. You
                control this by using the <code>xxforms:revisit-handling</code> attribute on the first XForms model
                of the page you want to reload. This attribute supports two values: <code>restore</code> (the
                default) and <code>reload</code>. Example:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                <xforms:model xxforms:revisit-handling="reload"/>
            </xml-source>
            <note>
                It is recommended to use the <code>reload</code> value carefully, as reloading pages upon browser
                navigation often does not match the expectation of the user.
            </note>

            <title>Encryption</title>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms encrypt some information sent to the client (for example when using client-side state
                state handling). This is done through the following property in <code>properties.xml</code>:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                <property as="xs:string" name="oxf.xforms.password" value="REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD"/>
            </xml-source>
            <warning>
                <p>
                    It is strongly advised to change the default password in the property above.
                </p>
            </warning>
            <p>
                In addition, Orbeon Forms by default encrypts the value of selection controls before sending them to
                the client. This can be controlled with this property:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                <property as="xs:boolean" name="oxf.xforms.encrypt-item-values" value="true"/>
            </xml-source>
            <p>
                In general, this should be set to <code>true</code>, but you can set it to <code>false</code> if you
                need to access the value of selection controls through JavaScript on the client, or through offline
                binds.
